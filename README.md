# Social-Media-Project

A 'social network' application built with React and Node.js. The app allows users to create, like, comment, edit, and delete posts. Users can also view a catalog of all posts and see detailed views of individual posts. Authentication is implemented to ensure secure access to the app's features but that does not stop guest users
of seeing the catalog without of course having the ability to interact with it in any way.

## Features

- **Catalog**: View all posts created by users.
- **Create Posts**: Logged-in users can create new posts with text and images.
- **Like and Comment**: Logged-in users can like and comment on posts.
- **Edit and Delete Posts**: Users can edit and delete their own posts.
- **Post Details**: View detailed information about each post.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with login and registration.
