# Social-Media-Project

A 'social network' application built with React and Node.js. The app allows users to create, like, comment, edit, and delete posts. Users can also view a catalog of all posts and see detailed views of individual posts. Authentication is implemented to ensure secure access to the app's features but that does not stop guest users
of seeing the catalog without of course having the ability to interact with it in any way.
